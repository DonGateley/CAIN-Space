#Cain Space
Project to establish Cain Space.

What it takes to anchor spacetime is the act of defining some specific event in some CMB's phase space as a standard origin. Then any past or future event relative to it will have a universal and unique phase space coordinate with the same meaning to everyone simply prepared, everywhere. Universal, persistant spacetime stamps seems to me to have conceptual value and contain useful information. I'm not sure what all value yet, just a hunch.

I can see their use, for example, with blockchain or other crypto technologies where consistency, reliability and utility of meaning is important.

Canonical phase space transformations (Hamiltonian) between universal phase space points can be thought of or applied as services if you have common coin and a common map. That can't be a burdensome process though. Transform decompositions and optimizations must abound. Smartphones (and other systems) should have a Cain1 = Cain() system call that returns an immutable token, type CAIN, in Cain1 for an event representing the current approximate position of the device in Cain Space, or the Cainiverse. Instantiations of type CAINXFORM can hold any canonical phase space transformation and they can be composed as CainCompose(CainXform1, CainXform2,...). They can be applied as CainXform(Cain1) where Cain1 is type CAIN and the return is of type CAIN.

Functions are the usual Hamiltonian ones and obey Hamilton's Principle.

CainXform2 = CainDot(CainXform2) is the time derivative of the transform CainXform2

CainXform2 = CainDotProd(CainXform1, CainXform2) has the ususal meaning.

CainXform2 = CainPosition(CainXform1) transform representing the position in phase space.

CainXform2 = CainMomentum(CainXform1) transform representing the momentum in phase space.

CainPosition1 = CainXform(Cain1, CainPosition(CainXform1)) is instantaneous position of Cain1 transformed by CainXform1 in Cain space.

CainMomentum1 = CainXform(Cain1, CainMomentum(CainXform1) is instantaneous momentum of Cain1 transformed by CainXform1 in Cain space.  

CainXform3 = CainPoissonBracket(CainXform1, CainXform2) has the usual definition of Poisson Bracket.

(Definitions of generating functions and Actions to follow.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_transformation.  One can use libraries of canonical transformation tools with a bridge between.  Perhaps such an environment would be the best place to put this.  Anybody know of an existing canonical transform library for Hamiltonian mechanics?  

http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/gross/files/diplom.pdf goes deep into that.  Uses Mathematica which could be problematic if my RaspBerry Pi 3 with latest Raspbian didn't have that as well as full net access.  I might could just fire that up and see what it can do.  The paper tells me that the proper framework for defining and operating on all this is Mathematica.  With it and the packages he has added one can do anything I've contemplated here.  Connect that to a data source and this is under way.  I just wish I was facile in Mathematica.  Anyone? Some kind of simpler and more specific API such as I've started is also in order.  On the other hand, requiring a Mathematica license everywhere isn't a very good idea.  For development and test it can be a handy tool.  Tie it into IFTTT.  Asap.  It could be set up from the RPi and accessed by IFTTT as we limp our way up and it would be a fantastic tool thereafter.  Anyone?  To collaborate, use a RPi 3 with updated and upgraded raspbian.  Might as well swim in the same tidy ocean.  Dirt cheap too and accessable headless from LAN or WAN.  Just the board with a USB hard drive.  Sound adequate.

It could (should) be a standard for the presentation and sensing of virtual reality. My left hand can know where your face is no matter whose gear you wear. The phase (sub)space position of everything in my environment becomes standardized. Virtual reality spaces can be unversally "mounted" in real spaces by transformation across sensors, brands, and brand names. The Tower of Babel is gone in a stroke.

Conceptually there is a tie in to the user-centric QBist view of quantum mechanics and to the thinking of Neal Stephenson in his brilliant novel Anathem.

Using a universal spacetime stamp as a token (a Cain) one could arrange to track the (somewhat) real-time, universal interval between tokens or token networks, which is what is usually of greatest interest, and easily allow the saving of Universal World Lines, or CainLines, either absolute or relative (after some arbitrary transformation.)

It could provide a new standard framework for geo-history that could be easy to explore and interact with.

A verifiable vote could be registered anywhere. A beacon could be established at any point in spacetime and tracked. You might want to compare what the beacon says with what something else at that same physical point says. Surveying becomes a simple matter of clicking a button at chosen points and saving the results. All are on the same standard.  Pairs of these beacons (with suitable dynamic and cryptographic transforms for and between them) could be used as private communication channels.  Such arbitrary channels can be completely beyond private eyes.  If you don't know the pair of Cains defining the end points and the transforms in between it simply doesn't exist for you.  Channels can contain a perfectly private video chat created by any application at all.  Want to talk securely to someone's computer or phone or Alexa based on simply knowing where they are?  Piece of cake.

In fact I consider this an important thing to do if it hasn't been done. It's time, perhaps, to send up a bird with the right horns and some master synchronization capabilities to calibrate our other birds.

If I'm describing something that can be done short of flying birds I'd love to know more about it.

I created this project as a place for people who might understand it and its possible importance in order to discuss it and perhaps eventually create the Origin Event, or CainZero, and the framework for its use. I have few skills to apply to actually accomplishing it myself. Consider it preliminary at this particular Cain.

The reason for calling it Cain Space is obscure and probably won't last. A rationalization is "CMB as inertial name". Heavy sigh.

A description I just wrote a friend: In simple terms it allows one to time stamp his place in the cosmos, including all relevant motion information, so that even a suitably informed creature halfway across the visible universe, would give it the exact same meaning relative to the cosmos that you and your friend in Santa Cruz do. Time sequences of these stamps comprise something called a worldline. You could create a movie and anyone, anywhere in the connected universe would know and agree exactly where and when that was shot. If two disconnected universes run into each other a tracking transform can embed either one into the other.  One could even tune in to the same place at some time to possibly get more information about it. So could someone in the originally disconnected universe.  It's a static, continuous zipcode system for the cosmos. It's also, and probably most importantly, a universal file system.

A product to which it's position in Cain space could be added:

This would get the idea in people's hands before it did their heads. I ask for the priviledge of setting CainZero while using them. All I need for that is the ability one time to grab a phase space point that is "known" relative to some static CMB that can be defined and sensed somewhere. The firmer tied to our GPS system that can be the better.  Publish that here and it's done. Then zero in Cain space, CainZero, can become a transformed point from that point by declaration. A transform choice to be carefully made.

Does anyone who stumbles here know where I could get my hands on a perfectly good, used even, phase space point measurement registered somewhere from such a CMB space?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX4PZ-fW2YA  The more recent the better.  Anybody well versed in transformations that could help me select a point relative to that?  Once set its use can immediately begin.  The device sensor can use whatever is the best global positioning channel available but its resolution partially governs the precision within which realities can be made to match.  Near field matching should be a piece of cake regardless of the global accuracy.

This in the end could be Internet n.0 where I don't know quite what n is.  Its uniqueness as a universally addressable virtual ether can be guaranteed by declaration. It can be kept universe stable and physically tracking "Real Reality" if it's adjustable with feedback transforms.  Multiple disjoint virtual ethers should be possible rooted in this unique one time capture of "Reality" or in any other such virtual ether.  These latter can be set up as real time transform filters with subspaces, and cross referenced functionally.  Phase space is a magic carpet.  As I think I might have said, the practical link to quantum mechanics is as close as possible.  The thing is fully adaptable and capable of maintaining its own conformance to measurable reference things.  Beeables.  By using phase space a world of simulation is opened up immediately if someone knows how to find a way to get access and a bridge to it.  I'll bet that capability is in the cloud somewhere as a service.  Sigh, Mathematica again, I fear.

Babylonians invented zero. Let's give it meaning once and for all. Help me set and use CainZero.

This isn't a bad room to think in aloud.  I commit to posterity that everything about the room will remain free and open.  If courteous.
