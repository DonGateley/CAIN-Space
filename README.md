#Cain Space
Project to establish Cain Space.

What it takes to anchor spacetime is the act of defining some specific event in some CMB's phase space as a standard origin. Then any past or future event relative to it will have a universal and unique phase space coordinate with the same meaning to everyone simply prepared, everywhere. Universal persistant spacetime stamps seems to me to have conceptual value and contain useful information. I'm not sure what all value yet, just a hunch.

I can see their use, for example, with blockchain or other crypto technologies where consistency, reliability and utility of meaning is important.

Transformations between universal phase space points can be thought of or applied as services if you have common coin and a common map. That can't be a burdensome process though. Transform decompositions and optimizations must abound. Smartphones (and other systems) should have a Cain() system call that returns an immutable token for an event representing the current approximate position of the device in Cain Space, or the Cainiverse.

It could (should) be a standard for the presentation and sensing of virtual reality. My left hand can know where your face is no matter whose gear you wear. The phase (sub)space position of everything in my environment becomes standardized. Virtual reality spaces can be unversally "mounted" in real spaces by transformation across sensors, brands, and brand names. The Tower of Babel is gone in a stroke.

Conceptually there is a tie in to the user-centric QBist view of quantum mechanics and to the thinking of Neal Stephenson in his brilliant novel Anathem.

Using a universal spacetime stamp as a token (a Cain) one could arrange to track the (somewhat) real-time, universal interval between tokens or token networks, which is what is usually of greatest interest, and easily allow the saving of Universal World Lines, or CainLines, either absolute or relative (after some arbitrary transformation.)

It could provide a new standard framework for geo-history that could be easy to explore and interact with.

A verifiable vote could be registered anywhere. A beacon could be established at any point in spacetime and tracked. You might want to compare what the beacon says with what something else at that same physical point says. Surveying becomes a simple matter of clicking a button at chosen points and saving the results. All are on the same standard.

In fact I consider this an important thing to do if it hasn't been done. It's time, perhaps, to send up a bird with the right horns and some master synchronization capabilities to calibrate our other birds.

If I'm describing something that can be done short of flying birds I'd love to know more about it.

I created this project as a place for people who might understand it and its possible importance in order to discuss it and perhaps eventually create the Origin Event, or CainZero, and the framework for its use. I have few skills to apply to actually accomplishing it myself. Consider it preliminary at this particular Cain.

The reason for calling it Cain Space is obscure and probably won't last. A rationalization is "CMB as inertial name". Heavy sigh.

A description I just wrote a friend: In simple terms it allows one to time stamp his place in the cosmos, including all relevant motion information, so that even a suitably informed creature halfway across the visible universe, would give it the exact same meaning relative to the cosmos that you and your friend in Santa Cruz do. Time sequences of these stamps comprise something called a worldline. You could create a movie and anyone, anywhere in the universe would know and agree exactly where and when that was shot. One could even tune in to the same place at some time to possibly get more information about it. It's a static, continuous zipcode system for the cosmos. It's also, and probably most importantly, a universal file system.

A product to which it's position in Cain space could be added:

This would get the idea in people's hands before it did their heads. I ask for the priviledge of setting CainZero while using them. All I need for that is the ability one time to grab a phase space point that is "known" relative to some static CMB that can be defined and sensed somewhere. Publish that here and it's done. Then zero in Cain space, CainZero, can become a transformed point from that point by declaration. A transform choice to be carefully made.

Does anyone who stumbles here know where I could get my hands on a perfectly good, used even, phase space point measurement registered somewhere from such a CMB space?  The more recent the better.  Anybody well versed in transformations that could help me select a point relative to that?  Once set its use can immediately begin.  The device sensor can use whatever is the best global positioning channel available but its resolution partially governs the precision within which realities can be made to match.  Near field matching should be a piece of cake regardless of the global accuracy.

Babylonians invented zero. Let's give it meaning once and for all. Help me set and use CainZero.
