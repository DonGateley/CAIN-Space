# CAIN-Space
Project to establish CAIN Space or Cain Space.

What it takes to anchor spacetime is the act of defining some specific event in some CMB's phase space as a standard origin and then any past or future event will have a universal and unique phase space coordinate with the same meaning to everyone, everywhere. Universal spacetime stamps seems to me to have conceptual value and contain useful information. I'm not sure what value yet, just a hunch.

I can see their use, for example, with blockchain or other crypto technologies where consistency, reliability and utility of meaning is important.

Transformations between universal phase space points can be thought of or applied as services if you have common coin and a common map. That can't be a burdensome process though. An application I just thought of would be a standard for the presentation and sensing of virtual reality. Conceptually there is a tie in to the user-centric QBist view of quantum mechanics. Using a spacetime stamp as a token I could arrange to track the (somewhat) real time interval between tokens, which is what is usually of greatest interest (the interval between my face and my right hand for instance), and easily allow the saving of universal world lines either absolute or relative (after arbitrary linear transformation.)

In fact I consider this an important thing to do if it hasn't been done. It's time, perhaps, to send up a bird with the right horns and some master synchronization capabilities to calibrate our other birds. I suggest the name BFIR (Best Fixed Inertial Reference) space to the project and to the name of the coordinate system that results.

If I'm describing something that can be done short of flying birds I'd love to know more about it.

I created this project as a place for people who might understand it and its possible importance in order to discuss it and perhaps eventually create the Origin Event and the framework for its use.

The reason for calling it CAIN Space is obscure and probably won't last.  Heavy sigh.
